# ETH template for beamer presentation
The present repository contains all the files required to create a beamer presentation with the ETH template. 
The files stored are **necessary and sufficient** for this aim.  
Customization of the main features should be as intuitive as possible, requiring changes only in the .tex file; additionally to the title, author name and date, the user can straightforwardly
- customize the figure displayed in the title page, 
- add complementary fields such as subtitle,supervisors and project type,
- optionally include the department/research group logo in addition to the standard ETH logo.
